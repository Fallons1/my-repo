    <p><em> My Philosophy</em></p>

For myself personally, teaching is a way of access to the world for both young and old minds. It allows for everyone to gain new knowledge about every subject as well as about the personal self, such as life skills, self confidence and more. Teaching, in my belief, is about the dance of academia and the human experience all coming together as one. In terms of secondary education, I believe the kids are the most important aspect to the learning environment because that is where it matters. Relating content to teens’ lives while also supporting adolescent development is significant to allowing for the growth of understanding the content area. It is also important because it allows for a deepening of perspective about the world and about other perspectives as well.
<p>Teaching, I believe, is also not only about the kids, but about the prepwork that is involved in lesson planning. A great skill to have is backwards lesson planning, making sure the assessments and the checks for understanding are just as strong as the unit itself. The assessments are a significant factor to student learning not only because it shows growth of comprehension, but also for reflection of both the teacher and the students. I also believe content should be engaging, and the use of a multitude of forms such as videos, lectures, primary and secondary sources, art, music and writing. Bringing the world into the classroom empowers students to appreciate those who have lived before them, as well as the cultures that are different from their own. Having different experiences also opens up to having a global perspective, which is helpful for young students when they grow and become part of the globalized world that we now live in. English as a subject is also a way to the future, and I like to acknowledge voices that usually do not get heard, such as minority voices.</p>
<p>I believe History and English is about ordinary people doing extraordinary things, and part of that is letting voices be heard, especially when those voices tend not to be given the power that they worked for.
I also believe, in terms of behavior of students, that being warm yet demanding is a good practice to have. It allows for the building of relationships as well as respect among both students and the teacher. It also allows for the practice of restorative justice, and this can be beneficial for conflict management as well as behavior reinforcement. Students talking openly about situations, emotions as well as solutions can help with life skills inside and outside of the academic environment. It also helps with peer relationships between students, creating a safe and healthy classroom environment.
With backwards lesson planning, hands-on activities, focusing on the students and being a warm demander using restorative justice as a tool, I believe teaching can change not only student’s lives to be successful in their academic careers, but also help students make a better future for themselves and the world.

	<h1>Long Term Goal</h1> 
<p>
My growth goal for 2021-22 was to develop daily schedules, timelines, classroom routines, and norms that maximize learning. My initial self assessment CSTP 1 Engaging and supporting all students in learning and CSTP 5 Assessing Students for learning were ranked as strengths while CSTP 3 Organizing subject matter and CSTP 4 Planning instruction were ranked as something I needed improvement on. In my final assessment, CSTP 3 was closer to the top of the rankings. 
	    </p>
 
	    <h4>In what ways have you surprised yourself?</h4>

In Inquiry 2 I focused on giving direct and immediate feedback to students as comments in google classroom, and I was surprised at how many students reacted positively. A lot of students responded back to me, and a lot more were more willing to re-do the assignment if they were missing parts. Since then I have given feedback on other assignments, leading to more assignments turned in as students know I am going to read and help them improve. 

Describe a professional goal you have for yourself beyond induction. Why have you identified this as a need or interest?

My post-induction goal would be to improve on CSTP 2 in creating and maintaining effective environments, and being able to use the space in my classroom more effectively. Due to the rise in numbers with Covid, I tried to use more digital than physical assignments, but in the future I would like to use the walls of my classroom for projects, as well as organizing desks that enhance the assignments and instructions. I would also like to use student group activities more. I believe this would create more movement and motivation from the students. In my lesson planning I will take into consideration where the students will be in the room and the layout of the classroom will go into my planning. I will assess this goal by the consistency of moving the classroom in my day-to-day lessons. 

	    <h2>What actions can you take to remain a connected educator throughout your career?</h2>
<p>
	<ul>
<li>I will get connected through online teacher groups that promote sharing of resources and collaboration</li> 
<li>I will stay connected with my colleagues by email, asking and answering questions and sharing ideas</li> 
<li>I will connect with the community at large by staying connected and keeping my relationships with parents and teachers in the same district as I am.</li> 
	    </ul>
	    </p>
<h3>What can you do personally and professionally, to sustain the energy it takes to be passionate about students, teaching, and learning?</h3>
<ul>

	<li>I can:</li>
<li>1. Engage in self - reflection and positive self talk. I can do this by realizing what I can improve, but also recognizing what also went right in the lesson.</li>

<li>2. Embrace the little joys of teaching. I have a folder that I have put positive notes that I have gotten from students or parents, and I can go back and read them on bad days. This year, I have even gotten some paintings and drawings from students that I leave near my desk and places where I can walk by and remember the good times.</li> 

<li>3. Making tasks more manageable. I can do this by focusing on breaking up tasks into smaller pieces, breaking up grading over time for example, instead of focusing on everything that needs to be done.</li> 

What advice do you have for new teachers entering the profession?

<li>1. Find your tribe. This can be teachers, coaches, janitorial staff, anyone around you that can be a positive influence and bring some light into the day. This helps with positivity and makes you feel less alone, especially when you are trying to figure everything out.</li> 

<li>2. Talk to colleagues for support and ideas. Be willing to try new things, even if you are uncertain!</li>

<li>3. Be willing to share what you do/create/use. You may get compliments and that will help with more positive self-reflection</li>

<li>4. Gamify. Get students involved in games and competitions. When students are having fun they are more likely to want to learn. It also helps relationship building.</li> 

<li>5. While the pandemic has changed some things, it also has made me realize that our students need us (even if they will never admit it) Talk with them, spend time with them, they want positive adult role models and you can easily be that for them. Have fun with it!</li>

		<h1>Contributing to the profession</h2> 
	<p>
As a teacher, we have amazing tools at our disposal to use to help support our students. I will be sharing three that have been a game changer for my classroom, in terms of promoting new learning opportunities, engagement and supporting growth. 
</p>
<h2>Blooket</h2>
	<a target="_blank" href="https://www.blooket.com/">Blooket</a>
 <p>
Booklet is a very fun and engaging learning activity that my students this year became obsessed with. I have primarily used it as a tool to review, and even my students who struggled with my assignments got a lot out of playing Booklet. It is free, with a fairly affordable yearly subscription. I highly recommend this site because students get a lot out of it, you are able to review content while building community, and it helps reinforce learning. You are able to create your own quizzes, or use the quizzes that other teachers have made. The only downside of the site is that it has multiple choice questions only, though this does help English learners. I have used it to: Review vocabulary, grammar concepts and even plot points from our novel. Here is just a screenshot of the data that you can get from the quiz:

	<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/rwMspYCY/blooket-img-2.png" alt="blooket" width="350" height="250">
	
	<p>
As you can see, you can see the data of the whole class, and on the individual level. The reason why you see 10/10 on this student's score is because the booklet gives the same question multiple times, so that it gives some repetition. I can see what the students really struggled on, and then in my lessons review and support what the weaknesses were. (Blooket LLC, 2022)

<h3>Group Reading Activity</h3>
<p>	
 Teacher created lesson: <a target="_blank" href=https://jamboard.google.com/d/1YLIWGWHzJqRtO_2fd8A0Rl3vdYr_IU6ucUPHwm3sDaw/edit?usp=sharing">Jamboard</a>
	 </p>
	 
	 <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/wMDxqhtp/Jamboard-img.png" alt="jamboard" width="350" height="250">
	 
<p>
This is a resource that I created to help support my students in analyzing texts through google Jamboard. Google Jamboard is free, and works like a digital whiteboard. It works great for student groups, which this resource was made for. Each student has a role, and each role has clearly defined expectations with sentence frames. There are 5 slides in all total, with an option for a 5th person. This resource can be used for fiction, nonfiction, chapter or a small passage. I have used this resource for students to analyze chapters in our novel, and students were very engaged and able to talk about the book. It also provides differentiation, as each role has different expectations. You can even have students rotate roles! This is a very powerful resource and I am excited to share it with you: . 
‘The beauty of this is, this can be used for any subject!

<h4>Teacher created lesson: Exit Tickets</h4> 
	
	  <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/FRLNpjVL/Exit-image.png" alt="Exit Ticket" width="250" height="250">
	
<p>
Exit tickets are a way for students to review materials and reflect on class. I have found that when I give students time to reflect or ask questions, they tend to remember lessons the next day. I have created a simple exit ticket with sentence frames in order to support students and I am excited to share it with you! This can be used for any subject. 
	 </p>
	 <p>
The sentence frames are: 
I wonder _______________. This question prompts them to wonder something about the day, class or lesson. 
	 </p>
	 <p>
Today I learned ___________. This allows students to tell you directly what they what they learned during class. 
	 </p>
	 <p>
I usually give these exit tickets right at the end, before they leave. This has become a norm and routine for my classes.
